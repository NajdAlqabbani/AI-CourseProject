1. Description
In this project you will write three interactive AI tutorials (Solving Problems by 
Searching, Adversarial Search and Constraint Satisfaction). You will write them as 
Jupyter notebooks which implement and explain some of the essential algorithms 
you have seen in class.
The Jupyter notebook has to explain the algorithms and related concepts in both 
Arabic and English, and most importantly it has to explain how to implement the 
algorithms from scratch. 
The notebook should also contain at least one appropriate formulated problem for 
each notebook, to which the algorithms are applied, and, where applicable, their 
performance evaluated and compared. These problems should preferably be 
simplified problems from our background and daily interactions.
You should guide the reader to test and change variables in the problem/algorithm
so they can understand the important concepts. 
The following table contains the algorithms you need to explain, implement, and 
show their performance on the formulated problem.


 
 Main Concepts Algorithms


 Game trees
o Game as search (initial state, state 
space, goal state)
o Evaluation function
o Alpha-cut and Beta-cut
o Performance measure
o Example for each concept
o Any knowledge you learnt about 
Games

 Min-Max
 Alpha-Beta

A suggested notebook layout is as follows:
 Introduction 
o Explains the objectives and main concepts.
 An example game X-O
o Explains the problem and its formulation.
 The algorithms, 
for the two algorithm
o Explanation
o Implementation
o Applying the two algorithm on the X_O game (graphic interface is 
desirable)
o Testing the two algorithms on several samples of X_O games (10
times) and reporting the results (number of wins, time, the size of the 
tree, depth tree). 
 NB: The horizon and the evaluation function should be the 
same for both algorithms.
o Compare and Interpret your experimental results 
 References and resources
